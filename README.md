# Math-156-Final-Project



- Clean the data (not hard, we just need to remove some missing years)
- Possibly bring in one or two other data sets


1. Decide on uni or multivariate regression (multivariate is probably better)
- Type up our own mean squares algorithm (which we can double check using the function) [Marieth and Nicole]


2. Look into other models:  k nearest neighbors [Find Eucledian distance] 
-derive both (for classification, we just take y = response varaible = social support) [Matthew]

3. PCA (can be done with the regression) [Nancy]

derive = typing it up in latex

Compare clustering to polynomial to degree to PCA
Compare principal components to degree to optimized clusters
